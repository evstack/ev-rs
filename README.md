# Evolve

Evolve is a simple and ergonomic rust software development kit.

The goal of the project is to build a diverse ecosystem of users allowing applications to freely customize and innovate
without needing to start from scratch. We set out to build evolve from the learning we had working and developing the
Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK is useful sdk to develop a L1, while it provides lots of things that users need we saw the
limitations in our expressivity through software. This came down to adoption, the Cosmos SDK gained adoption, too fast (
a good thing), before there was a clear understanding of how the Blockchain space could develop and innovate. Evolve is
developed by a group of developers who have worked on Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, IBC and built applications in solidity,
Solana, and Move. While Evolve could have been a complex project shooting for the moon, we opted to develop a set of
simple primitives allowing anyone to build a set of modules, integrate with any VM and work with any consensus engine.

## Modules

Here is a list of modules that are supported out of the box with Evolve:
